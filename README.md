# Deck of Cards Problem Statement
Design a set of classes in JAVA that represent a deck of poker-style playing cards. (Fifty-two playing cards in four suits: hearts, spades, clubs, diamonds, with face values of Ace, 2-10, Jack, Queen, and King.)

Within one of your classes, you must provide two ​operations:

- **shuffle()**
Shuffle returns no value, but results in the cards in the deck being
randomly permuted. Please do not use library-provided “shuffle” operations to
implement this function. You may use library provided random number generators
in your solution if needed.
- **dealOneCard()** 
This function should return one card from the deck to the caller.
Specifically, a call to shuffle followed by 52 calls to dealOneCard() should result in
the caller being provided all 52 cards of the deck in a random order. If the caller
then makes a 53rd call dealOneCard(), no card is dealt.
